This program was made to record my code process for an upcoming youtube video.
It is VERY efficient with storage space and doesn't require post-editing compression.
The program takes a screenshot on an interval you can specify (2s by default) as a .jpg with mss
and then later turns it into an .mp4 video using opencv.
