# Efficient Timelapse App
This program was made to record my screen and coding process for an upcoming YouTube video.  <br/>
It is designed to be VERY efficient with storage space as it doesn't record in standard fps (eg 30, 60).
The efficiency of the program can likely still be further optimized by using wepb, avif or other, smaller image formats <br/>
The program takes a screenshot on a user specified interval (2s by default) as a .jpg with mss
and then later turns it into an .mp4 video using opencv.  <br/>

This project was created due to a lack of such programs on the internet (that I could personally find), a desire to be efficient with my available hard drive space, and wanting to practice python GUIs. <br/>
(also the settings that would have to be changed on OBS for this are painful and just not worth it every single time I want to create a timelapse)

For anyone that finds this and needs it, enjoy!
The .exe can be found in the dist folder.
